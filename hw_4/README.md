All of my work is contained inside of the hw_4.ipynb notebook. The 'analysis_plot_all.png' has a plot of all of my data. One note for this, for the serial and IPcluster implementations of the algorithm, I ran each simulation (for a given number of darts thrown) 50 times to gather statistics, but for the multiprocessing implementation I ran each simulation only 10 times to save time.
